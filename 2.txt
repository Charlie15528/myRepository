## Dear Diary,
Today marked a **paradigm shift** in my workflow, spanning novel methodologies for literature review, system operations, and scripting protocols.

### I. Literature Review Methodology
By adhering to a structured schema, my objectives have crystallized. This approach significantly enhances my retrieval of prerequisites and analytical derivations, mitigating the cognitive overload often induced by extensive manuscripts.

1. **Protocol 1 (Standardized Template):** I implemented a fixed template for reading. This process involves iterative refinement—I consciously adjust the content during the review.
2. **Protocol 2 (AI-Augmented Inquiry):** The rationale hinges on maximizing AI utility via precise **prompt engineering**. I now rigorously interrogate the text concerning:
    * The control plant and fundamental principles.
    * The nexus of control logic.
    * Critical contributions.
3. **Protocol 3 (Granular Synchronization):** I adopted a page-by-page annotation strategy. Since AI tends toward macro-summarization, this granular approach prevents **"learning latency"** where human comprehension lags behind algorithmic output.

### II. Technical Troubleshooting
I encountered and resolved specific software bottlenecks:

* **MS Word Latency:** Switching to **"Draft View"** effectively eliminated input lag during complex document editing.
* **Windows Explorer Failure:** Restarting the process via `Shift+Esc` (Task Manager) successfully restored the rendering of the upper UI and context menus.

### III. Scripting & Automation
Leveraging Claude, I developed three iterations of a Python script for course registration: a **CLI version**, a **GUI with hardcoded selectors**, and an **interactive GUI**.

1. **Current Constraints:** The primary challenge lies in the stochastic nature of the target buttons (necessitating exclusion logic) and a **"stale state"** issue—the script executes on a static page without auto-refreshing prior to the registration window.
2. **Learning Curve:** I am concurrently assimilating Python syntax and the logic of simulating mouse events.

### IV. Career Trajectory
* **Kelvin Corp Recruitment Seminar:** Registered for Jan 8th.
* **Competition:** Joined an industrial software competition.
* **Self-Refection:** The completion of my career planning assignment has provided distinct clarity on my professional trajectory.
